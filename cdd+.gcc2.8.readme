The cdd+ version 075 was written for gcc-2.7.2, and it has a little
problem when it is compiled with gcc-2.8.*.   

The revised distribution cdd+-075a of cdd+075 contains a revised
version of cddio.C which enables gcc-2.8.* to compile correctly.
Make sure that a compatible libg++, for example, libg++-2.8.1.1a
is installed correctly as well as gcc-2.8.* (or egcs-1.0.*).
